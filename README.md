# Random Quote Machine

A simple app that fetches and displays random quotes from an API. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This app displays a random quote each time you press the "Get Quote" button. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to understand. The app retrieves the quote data from a public API and dynamically updates the UI to show a new quote. The project can be further extended by adding features such as favorite quotes, author search, and more.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KAY-DEVPV-2o2/random-quote-machine.git
cd random-quote-machine
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all project dependencies:

If you’re using **npm**:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you prefer **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the application

To start the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. Open the application

Visit the following URL to view the app:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Commonly Used Commands

- **Start the development server**:  
  `npm start` or `yarn start`  
  Starts the app in development mode.

- **Build the app for production**:  
  `npm run build` or `yarn build`  
  This will build the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing it for the best performance.

- **Run tests**:  
  `npm test` or `yarn test`  
  This runs the unit tests and the test suite in watch mode.

- **Eject the configuration**:  
  `npm run eject`  
  This is a one-way operation that removes the single build dependency, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **npm/Yarn**: For managing dependencies and running scripts.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch random quotes.
